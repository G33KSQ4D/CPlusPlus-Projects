Hello! I'm not sure how you may have stumbled in this code repository, but I'm glad you're here.

The code inside this repository is nothing to serious since I'm just starting C++. I do however plan on getting better and changing this text file to say it contains real code.

I made this repository mainly to upload code to perhaps show employers, learn to use git, and learn C++.
