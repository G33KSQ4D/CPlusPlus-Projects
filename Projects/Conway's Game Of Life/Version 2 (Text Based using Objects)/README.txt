This is version two of Conway's Game Of Life.

My first project was a challenge and somewhat messy. I plan to make the code neater this time and more organized using objects.

I'm gonna start this project almost from scratch and implement new things.

I'm not going to recopy functions from version one because the entire point of this is to learn, and I already learned what I needed for functions.
